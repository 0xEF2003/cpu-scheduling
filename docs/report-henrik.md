# Contribution

During this project, both I and Elias sat in a discord call working on the project.
We have both written code and discuss the project.

We tried to bounce the ball on who worked on the project back and forth, but the workload was not evenly distributed.

# What has been learnt

During this project I have learnt the different CPU scheduling algorithms and how they work.
We decided to implement the Round Robin algorithm, and SFJ as well to get a deeper understanding of all the algorithms
you have mentioned in class.
